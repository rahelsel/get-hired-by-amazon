## get-hired-by-amazon

A friend of mine who works at Amazon gave me this info on things you should know if you want to feel confident in an interview for a web development engineer position at the company:

HTML
- HTML5
- semantic markup
- Creating an HTML page from scratch (doctype, <html>, <head>, <body>, and other common stuff like charset and viewport devs need to know how to write their own code without relying on a framework i.e. Bootstrap is useful to know, but don't overly rely on it)

CSS
- CSS3
- selectors, basic performance / efficiency, (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Writing_efficient_CSS)
- display (what are the common uses of display? showing and hiding elements, how "display:none" is different from "visibility:hidden", differences between inline, block, inline-block, knowledge of browser defaults for common elements (div, span, etc.)
- reusable styling (e.g. using the right selectors to apply styles to a component (e.g. a button) in a reusable way)
- position (relative, absolute, fixed, uses of position property)
- how to layout a page or a component
- knowledge of flexbox (display: flex and related styles) can be helpful here
- knowledge of grid systems (cutting-edge stuff like CSS Grids is a bonus, but basically how to create and/or work with an existing grid system)
- CSS resets -- generally, what these are, what they do, and why they matter
- e.g. http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/
- e.g.  https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/ (not necessary to know how to write one, just good to know what they are)
 
JAVASCRIPT
- ES5
- ES6/7/next knowledge is a bonus, but this will become expected within a few years
- Object-Oriented Programming
- creating objects and object literals
- basics of how functional prototype works
- JSON
- web-related data structures and algorithms
- JSON manipulation
- DOM APIs
- interacting with forms
- memoize (basic caching)
- DOM
- getElementById, getElementsByTagName, getElementsByClassName, querySelector, querySelectorAll
- jQuery or similar is useful to know, but not required if they know the vanilla equivalent
- traversal (things like get elements with a specific class that are children of a specific node or nodes and do something)
- Events
- attach events to elements
- addEventListener
- event handling
- AJAX
- XMLHttpRequest
- jQuery is fine
- fetch or a fetch polyfill will become more relevant over time
 
WEB PERFORMANCE
- Steve Souders books are useful here (the best practices are changing over time though)
- reduce HTTP requests
- CSS/JS: concatenate, minify, gzip
- JS: load critical components early and async, delay loading of unimportant assets
 
HTTP
- knowing basics of how HTTP works and how a page communicates with server for things like AJAX
- know how forms work (HTML) and different HTTP methods like GET and POST
 
WEB SKILLZ
- cross-browser compatibility
- progressive enhancement / graceful degradation
- reusable components (HTML, CSS, JS) -- e.g. a button, star ratings, etc.
- basic SEO knowledge (e.g. if stuff requires JS to render, search engines won't necessarily see it)
- basic web security (why HTTPS should be used, how to avoid common attacks like XSS)
 
MOBILE SKILLZ
- Mobile First approach is becoming more relevant, importance depends on the team and the projects
- Responsive -- CSS media queries and/or RESS (responsive with server side components)

Okee so time to review!!!
